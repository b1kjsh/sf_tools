========

These are all of my userscripts I use to make salesforce more manageable. 

Prerequisites:

GreaseMonkey - Firefox
TamperMonkey - Chrome
Go_Google_IT - Internet Exploder

Open the raw master.user.js (https://github.com/b1kjsh/sf_tools/raw/master/master.user.js) and get all the current stable scripts. Or you can add scripts individually by navigating to the UserScripts folder and selecting one from there.
